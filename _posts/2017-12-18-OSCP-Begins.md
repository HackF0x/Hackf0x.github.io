#So it begins, the first day in the OSCP labs.

My scheduled lab time kicked off at 7PM EST Saturday. My lab pack came in at exactly 7PM (1900) on the dot. I figured the VM for the lab was pretty much the same as the one they had me download for the lab connectivity test so I hopped right into the lab while I waited for the course videos to download. I wanted to just poke around a bit before I really dove into the course material. I ended up finding an easily exploited machine that I will have to go back through and exploit again later due to my lack of documentation of what I did. I highly doubt many of the machines in the network will be as easy as Alice was and that isn't a bad thing. Outside of handlers, I want to use as little Metasploit as possible in the labs. 

After the videos finished downloading I looked briefly over them and the accompanying PDF. I am going to go through the course materials first and fill out the exercises section as I go. Which brings me to my next point: Documentation is key. Their report template has a heavy emphasis on screenshots, so I will follow their guidelines as closely as I can.

I am hoping to have the course material wrapped up within a couple of weeks before I really dig into the labs. Most blogs I read seem to echo the same thing: "Do the exercises before tackling the lab".
